# Deathstar
Deathstar; C++; OpenGL; glfw; glm; stb

This repository is essentially a rudimentary example of graphics programming via OpenGL and C++.  Included is a limited representation of our solar system that tries to account for the rotational speed of the celestial bodies contained there-in.  This example is by no means optimized for performance but does seek to help demonstrate OpenGL textures, shaders, translations, projections, etc.  The initial boilerplate code is adapted from Sonny Chan's work at the University of Calgary.  

As with all of my repositories, feel free to collaborate, expand/reduce, enhance, etc if you feel so inclined. Pull requests are always welcomed as the main goal is to help others interested, learn by example.
